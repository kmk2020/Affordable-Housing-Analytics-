# Affordable-Housing-Analytics-

According to (Khan, Weller, & Roberts, 2022), the United states had an estimated shortage of 7 million affordable homes for low-income renters. This can as well be stated as 37 affordable housing for every 100 low-income renter households. The statistics provide an indication of the challenges that low-income economically challenged families in America face.

This results in other unwanted problems for the families such as housing insecurities, poor academic performances for students, homelessness, toxic stress among others.

The proposed affordable housing data analytics project aims at utilizing housing data from Zillow a company that collects and researches on the housing market in the US.  Zillow utilizes a Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) which is basically ‘…a measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range’ (Zillow, 2022)

The aim of this project is to build a model information system that can utilized by low-income earners to locate locations with affordable rental properties for them while also allowing US policy makers to visualize the real plight of low-income earners just as they would do for homeowners.

According to (Khan, Weller, & Roberts, 2022), the US government can offer renters increased subsidies. This project will be a great benefit in aiding reduce a clear visualization of the rental market while comparing different aspects of the housing dynamics.
